#
# The orthographic accent or 'tilde' is a sign used in Spanish generally over a
# vowel (a, e, i, o, u). In some Romances languages, as Spanish and Catalan, is
# often used the diacritic accent to difference some words from others with the
# same writing but with different meanings and use cases.
#
# In several languages ​​the orthographic accent has some variants, including: the
# acute accent (´), the circumflex accent (^) or grave accent (`). In many languages​​,
# each type of accent can fall on different types of speech. In Spanish, the acute
# accent is the only thing that can go over a vowel. In French the circumflex
# accent is used to indicate the elongation of a vowel by the loss of the letter
# "s" implosive, although in Portuguese the same accent is intended to indicate
# the degree of opening of the vowel.
