 * Exchangeable image file format (Exif, often incorrectly EXIF) is a standard
 * that specifies the formats for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by
 * digital cameras (including smartphones), scanners and other systems handling
 * image and sound files recorded by digital cameras. The specification uses the
 * following existing file formats with the addition of specific metadata tags:
 * JPEG Discrete cosine transform (DCT) for compressed image files, TIFF Rev.
 * 6.0 (RGB or YCbCr) for uncompressed image files, and RIFF WAV for audio files
 * (Linear PCM or ITU-T G.711 Î¼-Law PCM for uncompressed audio data, and IMA-ADPCM
 * for compressed audio data). It is not supported in JPEG 2000, PNG, or GIF.
