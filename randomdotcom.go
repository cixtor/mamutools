 *
 * The domain name com is a top-level domain (TLD) in the Domain Name System of
 * the Internet. Its name is derived from the word commercial,[1] indicating its
 * original intended purpose for domains registered by commercial organizations.
 * However, eventually the distinction was lost when .com, .org and .net were
 * opened for unrestricted registration.
 *
 * The domain was originally administered by the United States Department of
 * Defense, but is today operated by Verisign, and remains under ultimate
 * jurisdiction of U.S. law. Verisign Registrations in com are processed via
 * registrars accredited by ICANN. The registry accepts internationalized domain
 * names. The domain was one of the original top-level domains (TLDs) in the
 * Internet when the Domain Name System was implemented in January 1985, the
 * others being edu, gov, mil, net, org, and arpa. It has grown into the largest
 * top-level domain.
