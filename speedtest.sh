#
# Time To First Byte or TTFB is a measurement that is often used as an
# indication of the responsiveness of a webserver or other network resources. It
# is the duration from the virtual user making an HTTP request to the first byte
# of the page being received by the browser. This time is made up of the socket
# connection time, the time taken to send the HTTP request, and the time taken
# to get the first byte of the page.
