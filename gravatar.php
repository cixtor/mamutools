 *
 * An avatar is an image that represents a person online, basically a little
 * picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites. A
 * Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your
 * profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site,
 * your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.
 *
 * Gravatar is a free service for site owners, developers, and users. It is
 * automatically included in every WordPress account and is run and supported
 * by Automattic.
