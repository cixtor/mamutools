# In information technology, a backup, or the process of backing up, refers to
# the copying and archiving of computer data so it may be used to restore the
# original after a data loss event.
#
# Backups have two distinct purposes. The primary purpose is to recover data
# after its loss, be it by data deletion or corruption. The secondary purpose
# of backups is to recover data from an earlier time, according to a user-defined
# data retention policy, typically configured within a backup application for
# how long copies of data are required. Though backups popularly represent a
# simple form of disaster recovery, and should be part of a disaster recovery
# plan, by themselves, backups should not alone be considered disaster recovery.
#
# One reason for this is that not all backup systems or backup applications are
# able to reconstitute a computer system or other complex configurations such
# as a computer cluster, active directory servers, or a database server, by
# restoring only data from a backup.
#
# Since a backup system contains at least one copy of all data worth saving,
# the data storage requirements can be significant. Organizing this storage
# space and managing the backup process can be a complicated undertaking. A
# data repository model can be used to provide structure to the storage.
# Nowadays, there are many different types of data storage devices that are
# useful for making backups. There are also many different ways in which these
# devices can be arranged to provide geographic redundancy, data security, and
# portability.
