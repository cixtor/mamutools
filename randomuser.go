 * Randomness means lack of pattern or predictability in events. A random
 * sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does not follow an
 * intelligible pattern or combination. Individual random events are by
 * definition unpredictable, but in many cases the frequency of different
 * outcomes over a large number of events or trials is predictable. In this
 * view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than
 * haphazardness, and applies to concepts of chance, probability, and
 * information entropy.
