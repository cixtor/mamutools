# Brackets is an open source code editor for web designers and front-end developers.
#
# Upgrading is the process of replacing a product with a newer version of the same
# product. In computing and consumer electronics an upgrade is generally a replacement
# of hardware, software or firmware with a newer or better version, in order to bring
# the system up to date or to improve its characteristics.
#
# Examples of common hardware upgrades include installing additional memory (RAM),
# adding larger hard disks, replacing microprocessor cards or graphics cards, and
# installing new versions of software. Many other upgrades are often possible as
# well. Common software upgrades include changing the version of an operating system,
# of an office suite, of an anti-virus program, or of various other tools.
#
# Although developers usually produce upgrades in order to improve a product, there
# are risks involvedâ€”including the possibility that the upgrade will worsen the product.
# Upgrades can also worsen a product subjectively. A user may prefer an older version
# even if a newer version functions perfectly as designed.
