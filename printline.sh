#
# The cat program is a standard Unix utility that concatenates and lists files. The
# name is an abbreviation of catenate, a synonym of concatenate. The Single Unix
# Specification specifies that when the "cat" program is given files in a sequence
# as arguments, it will output their contents to the standard output in the same
# sequence. It mandates the support of one option flag, u (unbuffered), by which
# each byte is written to standard output without buffering as it is read. Many
# operating systems do this by default and ignore the flag.
