 * Geolocation is the identification of the real-world geographic location of an
 * object, such as a radar source, mobile phone or Internet-connected computer
 * terminal. Geolocation may refer to the practice of assessing the location, or
 * to the actual assessed location. Geolocation is closely related to the use of
 * positioning systems but may be distinguished from it by a greater emphasis on
 * determining a meaningful location (e.g. a street address) rather than just a
 * set of geographic coordinates.
 *
 * Internet and computer geolocation can be performed by associating a
 * geographic location with the Internet Protocol (IP) address, MAC address,
 * RFID, hardware embedded article/production number, embedded software number
 * (such as UUID, Exif/IPTC/XMP or modern steganography), invoice, Wi-Fi
 * positioning system, device fingerprint, canvas fingerprinting or device GPS
 * coordinates, or other, perhaps self-disclosed information. Geolocation
 * usually works by automatically looking up an IP address on a WHOIS service
 * and retrieving the registrant's physical address.
