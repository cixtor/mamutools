# The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for
# computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private
# network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each
# of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates domain names,
# which can be easily memorized by humans, to the numerical IP addresses needed
# for the purpose of computer services and devices worldwide. The Domain Name
# System is an essential component of the functionality of most Internet
# services because it is the Internet's primary directory service.
#
# In computer networking, reverse DNS lookup or reverse DNS resolution (rDNS) is
# the determination of a domain name that is associated with a given IP address
# using the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.
