 *
 * A file server is a computer attached to a network that has the primary
 * purpose of providing a location for shared disk access, i.e. shared storage
 * of computer files (such as documents, sound files, photographs, movies,
 * images, databases, etc.) that can be accessed by the workstations that are
 * attached to the same computer network. The term server highlights the role of
 * the machine in the clientâ€“server scheme, where the clients are the
 * workstations using the storage.
 *
 * A file server is not intended to perform computational tasks, and does not
 * run programs on behalf of its clients. It is designed primarily to enable the
 * storage and retrieval of data while the computation is carried out by the
 * workstations.
