#
# JSON or JavaScript Object Notation, is a text-based open standard designed for
# human-readable data interchange. It is derived from the JavaScript scripting
# language for representing simple data structures and associative arrays, called
# objects. Despite its relationship to JavaScript, it is language-independent,
# with parsers available for many languages.
#
# The JSON format was originally specified by Douglas Crockford, and is described
# in RFC 4627. The official Internet media type for JSON is application/json. The
# JSON filename extension is .json. The JSON format is often used for serializing
# and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used primarily
# to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative
# to XML.
