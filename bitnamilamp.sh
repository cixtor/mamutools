#
# LAMP is an archetypal model of web service solution stacks, named as an
# acronym of the names of its original four open-source components: the Linux
# operating system, the Apache HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database
# management system (RDBMS), and the PHP programming language. The LAMP
# components are largely interchangeable and not limited to the original
# selection. As a solution stack, LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web
# sites and web applications.
#
# Bitnami LAMP Stack provides a complete, fully-integrated and ready to run LAMP
# development environment. In addition to PHP, MySQL and Apache, it includes
# FastCGI, OpenSSL, phpMyAdmin, ModSecurity, SQLite, Varnish, ImageMagick,
# xDebug, Xcache, OpenLDAP, ModSecurity, Memcache, OAuth, PEAR, PECL, APC, GD,
# cURL and other components
