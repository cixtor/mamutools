#
# DD (Data Description) is a command on Unix and Unix-like operating systems whose
# primary purpose is to convert and copy a file. On Unix, device drivers for
# hardware (such as hard disks) and special device files (such as /dev/zero and
# /dev/random) appear in the file system just like normal files; the command can
# also read and/or write from/to these files, provided that function is
# implemented in their respective driver. As a result, it can be used for tasks
# such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive, and obtaining a fixed amount
# of random data. The program can also perform conversions on the data as it is
# copied, including byte order swapping and conversion to and from the ASCII and
# EBCDIC text encodings.
