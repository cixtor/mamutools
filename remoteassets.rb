# A digital asset is any item of text or media that has been formatted into a
# binary source that includes the right to use it. A digital file without the
# right to use it is not an asset. Digital assets are categorised in three major
# groups which may be defined as textual content (digital assets), images (media
# assets) and multimedia (media assets).
