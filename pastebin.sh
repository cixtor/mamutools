#
# A Pastebin is a type of web application where anyone can store text for a
# certain period of time. This type of website is mainly used by programmers
# to store pieces of source code or configuration information, but anyone can
# basically share any type of text. The idea behind pastebins is to make it
# more convenient for people to share large amounts of text online.
#
# A vast number of pastebin related websites exist on the Internet, suiting
# a number of different needs and providing features tailored towards the
# crowd they focus on most.
