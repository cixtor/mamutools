 *
 * A flat file database describes any of various means to encode a database
 * model (most commonly a table) as a single file. A flat file can be a plain
 * text file or a binary file. There are usually no structural relationships
 * between the records.
 *
 * Plain text files usually contain one record per line,[2] There are different
 * conventions for depicting data. In comma-separated values and delimiter-
 * separated values files, fields can be separated by delimiters such as comma
 * or tab characters. In other cases, each field may have a fixed length; short
 * values may be padded with space characters. Extra formatting may be needed to
 * avoid delimiter collision. More complex solutions are markup languages and
 * programming languages.
 *
 * Typical examples of flat files are /etc/passwd and /etc/group on Unix-like
 * operating systems. Another example of a flat file is a name-and-address list
 * with the fields Name, Address, and Phone Number.
