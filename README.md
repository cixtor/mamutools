MamuTools is a collection of command line tools to complement the list of programs available in a regular Unix installation. The repository includes utilities to fetch remote data, format piped text, compression, packaging, string manipulation, among other things. These scripts were written in multiple programming languages to solve specific problems and to facilitate the execution of common tasks.

**WARNING:** As of August, 2018 the repository has been deprecated in favor of individual [Git repositories available here](https://github.com/cixtor?tab=repositories) that you can install on demand. The original project structure required users to install all the tools even though they needed just a couple of them.

### Additional Tools

There is a additional list of tools that were originally part of this repository but then were moved to independent projects for maintainability, easy distribution and reusability by 3rd-party programs.
