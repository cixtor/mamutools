 * The number PI is a mathematical constant, the ratio of a circle's
 * circumference to its diameter, commonly approximated as 3.14159. Being an
 * irrational number, PI cannot be expressed exactly as a common fraction,
 * although fractions such as 22/7 and other rational numbers are commonly used
 * to approximate PI. Consequently its decimal representation never ends and
 * never settles into a permanent repeating pattern. The digits appear to be
 * randomly distributed; however, to date, no proof of this has been discovered.
 * Also, PI is a transcendental number, a number that is not the root of any
 * non-zero polynomial having rational coefficients. This transcendence of PI
 * implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the
 * circle with a compass and straightedge.
