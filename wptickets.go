 *
 * The WordPress Support Forums are a fantastic resource with a ton of
 * information, but sometimes people have trouble getting help there and they
 * don't know why. This is usually the result of a communication gap. The
 * WordPress forums have one of the most helpful communities on the web, you
 * just need to help them help you. Note: Please read the Supported Versions
 * information as the the WordPress Support Forums only provide assistance for
 * officially released versions of WordPress.
 *
 * This tools sends HTTP requests to the latest twenty pages of the support page
 * of the specified plugin, finds how many of the tickets are marked as
 * resolved, and shows which ones are missing. Many people in the WordPress
 * community sees the number of resolved tickets per month as a sign of
 * responsiveness and promptness, other use this as one of the main reasons to
 * install or not a plugin.
