 * Hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a
 * radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the
 * symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or
 * alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.
 * Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer systems designers and
 * programmers. Several different notations are used to represent hexadecimal
 * constants in computing languages; the prefix "0x" is widespread due to its
 * use in Unix and C (and related operating systems and languages).
 *
 * Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent
 * binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64
 * representation. The particular set of 64 characters chosen to represent the
 * 64 place-values for the base varies between implementations. The general
 * strategy is to choose 64 characters that are both members of a subset common
 * to most encodings, and also printable. This combination leaves the data
 * unlikely to be modified in transit through information systems, such as
 * email, that were traditionally not 8-bit clean.
