 *
 * A component of software configuration management, revision control, also
 * known as version control or source control, is the management of changes to
 * documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of
 * information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, each
 * revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change.
 *
 * The profile contributions graph is a record of contributions you have made to
 * VCS (Version Control System) repositories but they are only counted if they
 * meet certain criteria. Commits will appear on your contributions graph if
 * they meet all of the following conditions:
 *
 * - The commits were made within the past year.
 * - The commits were made in a standalone repository, not a fork.
 * - The commits were made in the repository's default branch.
