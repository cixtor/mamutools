# Brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to
# be radiating or reflecting light. In other words, brightness is the perception
# elicited by the luminance of a visual target. This is a subjective attribute
# or property of an object being observed.
#
# Screen brightness can often be tricky to control. On many machines, physical
# hardware switches are missing and software solutions may or may not work well.
# Make sure to find a working method for your hardware! Too bright screens can
# cause eye strain. There are many ways to adjust the screen backlight of a
# monitor, laptop or integrated panel (such as the iMac) using software, but
# depending on hardware and model, sometimes only some options are available.
